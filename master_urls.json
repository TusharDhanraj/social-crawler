    "description": "Azad Kashmir\nAzad Jammu and Kashmir, abbreviated as AJK and commonly known as Azad Kashmir, is a self-governing administrative division of Pakistan. The territory lies west of the Indian-administered state of Jammu and Kashmir, and was previously part of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, which ceased to exist as a result of the first Kashmir war fought between India and Pakistan in 1947.Azad Kashmir is part of the greater Kashmir region, which is the subject of a long-running conflict between India and Pakistan. The territory shares a border with Gilgit–Baltistan, together with which it is referred to by the United Nations and other international organisations as \"Pakistan-administered Kashmir\". The territory also borders Pakistan's Punjab province to the south and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province to the west. To the east, Azad Kashmir is separated from the Indian-administered state of Jammu and Kashmir by the Line of Control, the de facto border between India and Pakistan. Azad Kashmir has a total area of 13297km2, with an estimated population of around 4.6 million people.\nKashmir Monitor\nThe Kashmir Monitor is the fastest growing English daily of Kashmir\nKashmir\n4.9\n(20) · Kashmir Page is dedicated to well wishers and fans of Kashmir all around the world...HIT LIKE & Explore the Heaven on Earth\nGreater Kashmir\n4.2\n(13,430) · Welcome to the Official Greater Kashmir on Facebook – a platform where you find comprehensive coverage & up-to-the-minute news, feature stories and videos.\nYouth of Kashmir\nYOUTH MAKES CHANGE.

It lies on the banks of the Jhelum River, a tributary of the Indus, and Dal and Anchar lakes. The city is famous for its gardens, waterfronts and houseboats. It is also known for traditional Kashmiri handicrafts and dried fruits.Origin of nameFolk etymology draws the city name from two Sanskrit words: śrī (\"glory, prosperity\", a name for the Hindu goddess Lakshmi) and nagar (\"city\"), which would make \"City of Lakshmi\" (or \"City of Prosperity\").However, the earliest records mention the name as siri-nagar which in turn is a local transformation of the original Sanskrit name sūrya-nagar, meaning \"City of the Sun\" (or, of a sun god).HistoryAncient periodThe Burzahom archaeological site located 10 km from Srinagar has revealed the presence of neolithic and megalithic cultures.According to Kalhana's 12th century text Rajatarangini, a king named Pravarasena II established a new capital named Pravarapura (also known as Pravarasena-pura). Based on topographical details, Pravarapura appears to be same as the modern city of Srinagar. Aurel Stein dates the king to 6th century.\nThe Kashmir Window\n5.0\n(5) · Welcome to the Official page of Kashmir Window on Facebook – a platform where you find comprehensive coverage & up-to-the-minute news, feature stories and videos.",
